Lab 2 Requriement

Please refer `drinks` and `chartjs_basics` Web projects and previous Python projects then do the followings

1. Use the `drinks.csv`, find out the mean alcoohol consumption for each kind of drinks per continent
   ```
   hint: groupby function would take `as_index` as parameter, when it set to `false`, it can keep the index column as part of the data rather than being index column.
   ```
2. Export the data into proper `json` format and save it into `/data/raw/` directory
3. Pick any of charts (other than radar chart) from the previous examples to visualize the data, keep in mind, you don't have to show all data.
